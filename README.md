Desiderata: Echoes of Resilience and Hope
# project overview
My project, "Desiderata: Echoes of Resilience and Hope," draws from Max Ehrmann's poem "Desiderata" to encapsulate the essence of communal strength and individual resilience during challenging times, especially in regards to the pandemic. This piece reflects that a community can rise above adversity and assist one another. My experiences at San Francisco State University, where students and faculty united for common causes, have deeply influenced my understanding of community as a space for shared experiences and mutual support. This project goes beyond an academic pursuit; it is a professional expression of how adversity can be met with solidarity and hope, strengthening communal bonds.
# technical overview
The digital presentation of "Desiderata" is achieved through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the poem into sections, each designed for specific animations, while CSS is used to apply various font styles to emphasize key words, enhancing their meaning and impact. Animations and hover effects in CSS symbolize the poem's themes of movement and change. The development environment for this project was Visual Studio Code, and it is hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring accessibility and visibility. The integration of these technologies and platforms allows for a seamless and engaging user experience, reflecting the poem's message through the medium of web design.
# acknowledgment
In the development of this project, I drew inspiration from the innovative work of past students, whose projects served as a benchmark for creativity and technical execution. I researched on the connotations and emotional impacts of specific words to ensure that their visual representation resonated deeply and aesthetically with viewers, aligning with my personal aesthetic and thematic preferences.
