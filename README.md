# Title
Visual Representation of "Desiderata" by Max Ehrmann

# Project Overview
With the use of Max Ehrmann's poem "Desiderata," my project aims to capture the core of community strength and individual resilience in difficult times, such as the ongoing pandemic. This work highlights the ability of communities to overcome challenges and support each other during difficult times. Most importantly highlights my experience and viewpoint during the 2020 pandemic. I’d say its meaning applies to the time I’ve spent at San Francisco State University, where students and faculty came together for common goals, which has shaped my view of the community as a place for shared experiences and mutual aid.

# Technical Overview
This visual display is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML divides the poem into different sections, where a specific word contains its own animation. CSS is where the animations are applied, highlighting/emphasizing the words, and boosting their significance and impact. The javascript is for extra and or complex animations.

# Acknowledgment
While working on this project, I drew motivation from the innovative work of past students. I delved deep into exploring the emotional meanings behind the poem's language, guaranteeing that its visual presentation online not only matches but also enhances the original message, allowing it to connect on both a visual and emotional level.
